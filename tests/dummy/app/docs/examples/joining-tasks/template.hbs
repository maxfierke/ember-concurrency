<h3>Awaiting Multiple Child Tasks (or, cancelable Promise.all, Promise.race)</h3>

<p>
  <strong>ember-concurrency</strong> provides Task-aware variants of
  <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/all">Promise.all</a> and
  <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/race">Promise.race</a>,
  which can be used in cases where a parent task wants to wait
  for multiple child tasks to run to completion (or throw an error)
  before continuing onward. The <strong>ember-concurrency</strong>
  variants both have the added benefit that if the parent task is canceled (or restarts),
  all of the child tasks will be automatically canceled. Similarly,
  in the case of <strong>all()</strong>,
  if any of the child tasks throws an error, all other child tasks
  are immediately canceled.
</p>

<h3>Live Example</h3>

<p>
  The example below can be started (or restarted) using either
  <code>all()</code> to wait for all child tasks to run to completion,
  or <code>race()</code> to wait for the first. Note that how, in both cases,
  <code>.maxConcurrency(3)</code> ensures that only 3 progress tasks
  run at a time, but if you restart the task while it's running, it immediately
  starts 3 tasks after canceling the previous ones.
